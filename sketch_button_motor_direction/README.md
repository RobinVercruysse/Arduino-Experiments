Switch DC motor direction on button press
=========================================

This is a combination of Arduino's "debounce" tutorial, and a motor shield tutorial on instructables.
* Debounce: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Debounce
* Motor shield: https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Motor-Shield-Tutorial/

Circuit is a combination of the two.
Code is included in this repo.

IMPORTANT: The code has been modified after the last test, so it may not work properly.

To do:
* remove use of LED, this is a remainder of the debounce tutorial and is not necessary
* change naming to be more descriptive
* include schematics image, try http://fritzing.org/home/
* adapt for 2 motors
